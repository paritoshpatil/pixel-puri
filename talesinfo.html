        <p class="info-text">Wanted to take a chance to really put down why I 
          thought this was a good idea for a gift because I still to get random-ass
          moments of panic when I think that I am just doing what I did last
          year and that you'd be really disappointed. 
          <br> <br>
          Not gonna lie, I just started 
          making the artworks because it was fun and didn't think about it much. 
          But later on I started thinking about how making art for each other is a 
          big part of our relationship - correct? 
          Since we spent one whole year mostly apart, we latched onto making these 
          small sketches for each other. We started almost exactly a year ago, when you
          gave me Puri tales and I think we've come full circle and it just feels 
          like a nice conclusion to our art gallery - ending with an invitation to our wedding and stuff haha 
          Hope this makes sense and hope you like it!
          <br> <br>
          I love you more than anything, Purva Puri ❤
          <br>
          Happy Birthday!</p>
