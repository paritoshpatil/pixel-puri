        <p class="info-text">There isn't much else to say other than that 
          I love you more than anything and I tried to do my best with what 
          I had at hand. You know my life and how it has been the past few 
          months better than anyone and I just want to say that making this 
          for you just gave me that little sparkle of joy every single day. 
          It just made me happy, as simple as that. I haven't really practiced 
          this, just writing down what I feel like and I feel like you are hot
          and beautiful and amazing and kind and soft and caring and bad-ass and
          a wonderful hooman and the best girlfriend ever.
          <br> <br>
          I love you ❤
          <br>
          Happy Birthday!</p>
