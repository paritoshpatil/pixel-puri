        <br>
        <p class="info-text">This started out as me making some designs that I could get printed out and 
          make cute little cards for your birthday gift -- but then covid happened (again!) 
          and I had to scrap the idea for your actual gift and I had to think fast on what to 
          do. So, I made another website haha such a new innovative idea, na? Bet nobody 
          has done that before! 
          <br> <br>
          Anyway, I really enjoyed putting some of our favorite memories into little artworks 
          and since I had decided to make 22 artworks for 22 years of your life, I had to make 
          one artwork everyday since I started which was a nice challenge and it was really really 
          fun. I really hope you like this and I really hope it makes your birthday 
          memorable. 
          <br> <br>
          I love you more than anything, Puru ❤
          <br>
          Happy Birthday!</p>
